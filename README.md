Project Goal
The primary goal of the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project is to develop a robust and accurate system that can automatically analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of tweets containing specific keywords or hashtags. This will be achieved by leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models to process and classify the sentiment of tweets effectively.

Project Scope
Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Acquire a dataset of tweets containing specific keywords or hashtags.
Develop a data preprocessing pipeline that includes cleaning, tokenization, and labeling of tweets.
Model Selection and Evaluation:
Evaluate and select appropriate pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) from Hugging Face.
Fine-tune and optimize the selected models for sentiment analysis.
Model Training and Implementation:
Implement model training scripts using the preprocessed data and selected models.
Train the models and assess their performance on the sentiment analysis task.
Documentation:
Document the project overview, methodology, and technical details comprehensively.
Ensure all steps, decisions, and outcomes are clearly explained and justified.
Deployment:
Develop a deployment strategy for the sentiment analysis system.
Implement the deployment, making the system accessible for analyzing new tweets in real-time or batch mode.
